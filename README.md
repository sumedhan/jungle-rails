# Jungle

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 4.2. 

## Project goals
- Become familiar with Ruby and the Rails framework
- Learn how to navigate an existing code-base
- Use existing code style and approach to implement new features in unfamiliar territory
- Apply previous learning tactics to research and become familiar with a new paradigm, language and framework
- A simulation of the real world where feature and bug-fix requests are listed instead of step-by-step instructions on how to implement a solution
